# Simple Text Editor built with PyQt5

## At the very minimum, the python module in this repository perfoms the following:

1. Open existing file for editing
2. Create a new file
3. Save an existing edited file
4. Save As functionality
5. Open the following file types: ".txt", ".py",".php"


### Besides the above mentioned possibilities, the editor also:
- displays column and row position of the cusor, and updates upon any relocation
- allows for text cut, copy and paste


## Implementation
This project was implemented with python language, specifically by PyQt5 package which comes with the following peer dependencies:
- PyQt5-Qt5
- PyQt5-sip

All the libraries that played some role in the completion of the task are listed in the [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file.
